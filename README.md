# AAV capsid evolution in human T cells identifies a family of CD7 targeting variants for efficient T and NK cell engineering
## Abstract
  This repository stores the code for the article “AAV capsid evolution in human T cells identifies a family of CD7 targeting variants for efficient T and NK cell engineering,” ensuring that all analyses and figures presented in the paper can be replicated by other researchers.
  We will provide data generated in our laboratory, public datasets, and analysis scripts. This includes four sections: AAV capsid sequence evolutionary analysis, AAV.APR31 receptor CRISPR screening, RNA-seq for safety assessment, and CD7 distribution in human tissues.
## Data & Code
### Section1: AAV capsid sequence evolutionary analysis (Fig.1 & Fig.S1)
  Raw sequencing data are stored in GSE302084, with `qc_CapIV.sh` used for preprocessing fastq files. `stat_CapIV.R` performs statistical analysis and visualization of AAV capsid sequences in the libraries using R. `20231219_CapIV_metadata.xlsx` contains the metadata corresponding to the raw fastq files.
